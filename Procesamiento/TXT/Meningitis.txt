and Prevention of Meningitis

 Acute meningitis is a medical emer-
   gency with a potential for high mor-  
   bidity and mortality. Bacterial  
   meningitis is life threatening, 
and must be distinguished from the more 
common aseptic (viral) meningitis. With 
increased use of conjugate vaccines, the 
annual incidence of bacterial meningitis in 
the United States declined from 1.9 to 1.5 
cases per 100,000 persons between 1998 
and 2003, with an overall mortality rate of 
15.6 percent.1-3 Incidence rates in developing 
countries remain significantly higher.
Etiology
Age, immunosuppression, and neurosurgical 
procedures increase the likelihood of infec -
tion from specific pathogens (Table 1) .3,4 In 
persons with community-acquired men -
ingitis, aseptic meningitis is significantly 
more common than bacterial meningitis;  
96 percent of children with cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) pleocytosis have aseptic meningitis.5 
The most common etiologies of aseptic men -
ingitis are enterovirus, herpes simplex virus 
(HSV), and Borrelia burgdorferi infections. In 
adults, the incidence of aseptic meningitis is 
7.6 cases per 100,000 persons, and the most 
common etiologies are enterovirus, HSV, 
and varicella-zoster virus infections.6 Other pathogens and diseases associated with asep -
tic meningitis include Treponema pallidum, 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, mumps, lympho -
cytic choriomeningitis virus, and acute ret -
roviral syndrome associated with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
Patients with mosquito-borne arboviral 
infections (e.g., West Nile virus, St. Louis 
encephalitis, the California encephali -
tis group) often present with encephalitis; 
however, they may present with meningeal 
involvement alone and no neurologic man -
ifestations. Seasonality is important in 
predicting the likelihood of aseptic menin -
gitis, because most enteroviral and arbovi -
ral infections occur in the summer or fall in 
temperate climates. Tuberculous and fungal 
meningitis are less common in the United 
States, and usually produce more chronic 
symptoms. Cryptococcal meningitis is com -
mon in patients with altered cellular immu -
nity, especially in those with advanced HIV 
infection (e.g., CD4 cell count of less than 
200 cells per mm3 [200 × 109 per L]).
Clinical  Presentation
In adults with community-acquired bacte -
rial meningitis, 25 percent have recent otitis 
or sinusitis, 12 percent have pneumonia, and Although the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis in the United States is declining, it remains a medical emer -
gency with a potential for high morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms are unreliable in distinguishing 
bacterial meningitis from the more common forms of aseptic meningitis; therefore, a lumbar puncture with cerebro -
spinal fluid analysis is recommended. Empiric antimicrobial therapy based on age and risk factors must be started 
promptly in patients with bacterial meningitis. Empiric therapy should not be delayed, even if a lumbar puncture 
cannot be performed because results of a computed tomography scan are pending or because the patient is awaiting 
transfer. Concomitant therapy with dexamethasone initiated before or at the time of antimicrobial therapy has been 
demonstrated to improve morbidity and mortality in adults with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Within the 
United States, almost 30 percent of strains of pneumococci, the most common etiologic agent of bacterial meningitis, 
are not susceptible to penicillin. Among adults in developed countries, the mortality rate from bacterial meningitis is 
21 percent. However, the use of conjugate vaccines has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children and 
adults. ( Am Fam Physician. 2010;82(12):1491-1498. Copyright © 2010 American Academy of Family Physicians.)

1492  American Family Physician www.aafp.org/afp  Volume 82, Number 12  ◆ December 15, 201016 percent are immunocompromised.7 Typical clinical 
features are listed in Table 2 .7 At least one of the cardinal 
features of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status 
is present in 99 to 100 percent of patients with meningi -
tis; when headache is included, two of the four features 
are observed in 95 percent of patients with meningitis.7,8 
The Kernig and Brudzinski signs are poorly sensitive but highly specific for bacterial meningitis.9 Sixty-three per -
cent of patients with meningococcal meningitis present 
with a rash that is usually petechial.7 Petechial rash may 
also be caused by Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococ -
cus pneumoniae infection. Pneumococcal meningitis is 
more likely than meningococcal meningitis to be associ -
ated with seizures, focal neurologic findings, and altered 
consciousness.
Compared with younger adults, persons 65 years and 
older with bacterial meningitis are less likely to have 
headache, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity, and 
are more likely to have seizures and hemiparesis.10 Simi -
larly, the classical features of bacterial meningitis are not 
observed as often in younger children, who may present 
with subtle findings, such as lethargy and irritability.11 
A recent history of upper respiratory tract infection is 
common in children with bacterial meningitis; chil -
dren are also more likely than adults to experience a sei -
zure.12 The illness course varies, with progression over 
hours to several days. The clinical features are nonspe -
cific. For example, in a study of 297 adults who under -
went a lumbar puncture for suspected meningitis, only  
80 (27 percent) had any degree of CSF pleocytosis, only 
20 (6.7 percent) had a white blood cell count of 100 cells 
per µL [0.10 × 109 per L] or higher, and only three (1 per -
cent) had culture-confirmed bacterial meningitis.9
Initial  Evaluation
Given the lack of specificity of clinical findings, the key 
to the diagnosis of meningitis is the evaluation of CSF.13 
The peripheral white blood cell count alone is not help -
ful in distinguishing bacterial from aseptic meningitis, Table  1. Common  Etiologies  of Bacterial  Meningitis  and Recommended  Empiric  Therapy*

cell count does not rule out bacterial meningitis).14 Men -
ingitis should be suspected in patients with those features 
previously noted that cannot be fully explained by other 
diagnoses. Lumbar puncture is a safe procedure, although 
postprocedure headache occurs in about one third of 
patients.15 (A video of a lumbar puncture is available at 
http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/355/13/e12.) 
The concern with lumbar puncture is the poorly quanti -
fied risk of herniation in patients with a space-occupying 
lesion or severe diffuse cerebral swelling, and the degree to 
which the risk can be recognized by a previous computed 
tomography scan. Life-threatening herniation from lum -
bar puncture has not been reported in patients who are 
neurologically unremarkable before the procedure.16
Based on patient series17 and guidelines,4,18 patients with 
risk factors for occult intracranial abnormalities should undergo computed tomography of the brain before  
lumbar puncture. This includes patients with central 
nervous system disease (including CSF shunts, hydro -
cephalus, trauma, space-occupying lesions or recent 
neurosurgery, immunocompromised state, papilledema, 
focal neurologic signs) and adults with new-onset sei -
zures or moderately to severely impaired consciousness 
(Figure 14,16-18). During the initial evaluation of a patient 
with suspected meningitis, diagnostic and therapeutic 
maneuvers should begin concomitantly. If a computed 
tomography scan is required before a lumbar puncture, 
blood cultures should be obtained, followed by prompt 
initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy before the 
scan. Adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone should be 
added in adults with suspected S. pneumoniae infection.19

single measure is diagnostic, a combination of abnormal 
CSF findings is highly suggestive of meningitis and help -
ful in determining the likely etiology (Table 3) . Rarely, 
patients with bacterial meningitis may present with nor -
mal or near-normal white blood cell counts, glucose lev -
els, and protein levels. This has been observed in young 
children with neutropenia and other immunocompro -
mised states, and very early in the course of meningococ -
cal meningitis.20 Lack of CSF leukocytosis and normal 
CSF glucose levels are also common in patients with 
HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis, but the CSF 
cryptococcal antigen test is highly sensitive and specific. 
Patients with partially treated bacterial meningitis and those with Listeria infection may have a CSF profile that 
is similar to aseptic meningitis. In children who have not 
received previous antimicrobial agents, clinical decision 
rules are useful in identifying those at low risk of bac -
terial meningitis and, if otherwise clinically stable, who 
are eligible for careful observation without antimicrobial 
therapy (Table 4).5,21

trials have been performed, observational studies have 
found that delays in therapy of as little as two to six hours 
are associated with adverse outcomes.22,23 Factors associ -
ated with a delay in antimicrobial therapy include failure 
to receive antimicrobials before transfer from another 
facility; performance of head computed tomography 
before lumbar puncture and antimicrobial administra -
tion; and the absence of the cardinal features of fever, 
neck stiffness, and altered mental status. When admin -
istered just before antimicrobial therapy is initiated, con -
comitant use of dexamethasone for four days has been 
shown to reduce mortality and improve neurologic out -
comes in adults with S. pneumoniae infection.19 It has not been shown to improve outcomes in other patient groups. 
Studies of patients in the developing world who have a 
high likelihood of HIV infection have not shown a clear 
benefit with adjunctive dexamethasone for pyogenic bac -
terial meningitis.24,25 Fluid management includes treat -
ment for possible dehydration or hyponatremia from the 
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.

however, it does not markedly influence the results of 
CSF Gram stain, which is positive in 60 to 70 percent of 
patients.26,28 
Polymerase chain reaction testing of CSF is more 
sensitive than CSF culture, particularly in patients who 
received previous antimicrobials.29,30 However, antimi -
crobial susceptibility testing, which is important in the 
treatment and prevention of meningitis, can be per -
formed only when the organism is grown in culture. In 
one series in the United States, 28 percent of pneumo -
cocci from patients with meningitis were not susceptible 
to penicillin, 6 percent were not susceptible to chloram -
phenicol, 17 percent were not susceptible to meropenem 
(Merrem), and 12 percent were not susceptible to cefo -
taxime (Claforan).1 Because of this degree of resistance, 
the administration of empiric therapy with vancomy -
cin and a third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime 
or ceftriaxone [Rocephin]) is recommended until the 
results of susceptibility tests are known.
Aseptic  Meningitis
Enteroviruses are the most common etiologic pathogens 
in persons with aseptic meningitis and do not require 
specific antimicrobial therapy. They can be diagnosed 
by CSF polymerase chain reaction testing,6 which is not 
always needed, but a positive test may be useful in dis -
continuing antimicrobials initiated presumptively for 
bacterial meningitis. If suggested by the patient’s sexual 
or substance use history, it is appropriate to order serum 
reactive plasma reagin (RPR), CSF Venereal Disease 
Research Laboratory (VDRL), serum HIV antibody, and 
serum HIV polymerase chain reaction tests. In acute 
HIV seroconversion, the serum HIV antibody test may 
be negative at the time of clinical presentation. 
HSV aseptic meningitis is usually a self-limited infec -
tion that must be distinguished from HSV encephalitis 
based on clinical and radiographic features; therapy with 
acyclovir (Zovirax) can be lifesaving in patients with 
HSV encephalitis. In contrast with HSV encephalitis, 
most patients with HSV aseptic meningitis have normal 
mental status and neurologic function, and do not have 
enhancement observed on magnetic resonance imaging 
of the temporal lobe. Both forms of HSV central nervous 
system disease are diagnosed by CSF HSV polymerase 
chain reaction testing. Infection with HSV may cause 
recurrent disease (e.g., Mollaret meningitis). Varicella-
zoster virus infection may cause aseptic meningitis in 
the absence of cutaneous manifestations.6 Although it 
has not been studied in clinical trials, therapy with acy -
clovir at 10 mg per kg every eight hours is suggested, based on expert opinion. Central nervous system Lyme 
disease is treated with ceftriaxone for 14 to 28 days, and 
central nervous system syphilis is treated with intrave -
nous penicillin for 10 to 14 days.
Tuberculous  and Cryptococcal  Meningitis
A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose tubercu -
lous meningitis because culture results are often delayed 
and stains are often negative. Empiric therapy may be 
lifesaving. Polymerase chain reaction testing may be use -
ful. Initial treatment is a combination of isoniazid (5 mg 
per kg per day in adults, 10 mg per kg per day in children, 
up to 300 mg); rifampin (10 mg per kg per day in adults,  
10 to 20 mg per kg per day in children, up to 600 mg); pyr -
azinamide (15 to 30 mg per kg per day, up to 2 g); and eth -
ambutol (15 to 25 mg per kg per day). Streptomycin (20 to 
40 mg per kg per day, up to 1 g) should be used in lieu of 
ethambutol in young children.31 Adding dexamethasone 
to the treatment regimen improves mortality in patients 
older than 14 years with tuberculous meningitis.32
Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common fungal 
meningitis, and usually occurs in patients with altered 
cellular immunity. Initial treatment includes amphoteri -
cin B (0.7 to 1.0 mg per kg per day intravenously) plus flu -
cytosine (Ancobon; 25 mg per kg every six hours orally).33
Prognosis
The mortality rate in adults with bacterial meningitis in 
developed countries is 21 percent; it is higher in patients 
with pneumococcal disease than in those with meningo -
coccal disease.7 Neurologic sequelae include hearing loss 
in 14 percent of patients and hemiparesis in 4 percent.7 
Risk factors for adverse outcomes include advanced age, 
alteration of mental status on admission, bacteremia, 
and a CSF white blood cell count of less than 1,000 per µL 
(1.00 × 109 per L).7 The mortality rate in children with 
bacterial meningitis is 3 percent; the incidence of stroke 
in children with bacterial meningitis is 3 percent.34
Prevention
Conjugate vaccines for H. influenzae type B and S. pneu -
moniae initiated in early childhood have been highly effec -
tive in reducing the incidence of bacterial meningitis, not 
only in children but also in adults.1,2 Although the overall 
incidence of pneumococcal meningitis has declined with 
the use of the conjugate vaccine, the percentage of menin -
gitis cases caused by nonvaccine serotypes has increased, 
as did the percentage of isolates that were not susceptible 
to penicillin and cefotaxime.1 A newer conjugate vaccine 
for Neisseria meningitidis (active against serogroups A, C, 
W135, and Y, but not serogroup B) is recommended in all Meningitis

Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is key to the diagnosis of meningitis. Decision rules using clinical and 
laboratory findings are highly sensitive in diagnosing meningitis in children.C 5, 8, 13, 21
Patients with risk factors for occult intracranial abnormalities should undergo computed tomography of the 
brain before lumbar puncture.C 17
If bacterial meningitis is suspected, empiric therapy with antimicrobials should not be delayed for more than 
one hour in patients awaiting diagnostic testing or transfers.C 4, 18, 22, 23
Adults with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection should receive concomitant 
dexamethasone with antimicrobial therapy to reduce mortality and improve neurologic outcomes.B 19, 25, 32
Conjugate vaccines for S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B are recommended for patients 
in appropriate risk groups to reduce the incidence of bacterial meningitis.B 1, 2
A = consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-
oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series. For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to http://www.aafp.
