“I love the doctors—they are dears; 
But must they spend such years and years Investigating such a lot Of illnesses which no one’s got, When everybody, young and old, Is frantic with the common cold? And I will eat my only hat If they know anything of that!”
1
The common cold is a conventional term for a mild
upper respiratory illness, the hallmark symptoms of whichare nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat,and cough. Although the term tends to imply that there isa single cause for the illness, the common cold is actually a
heterogeneous group of diseases caused by numerous
viruses that belong to several different families. Thecommon cold is usually a self-limited illness confined tothe upper respiratory tract. However, in some patients theviral infection spreads to adjacent organs, resulting indifferent clinical manifestations, and, occasionally, coldspredispose to bacterial complications.
Despite the usually benign nature of the illness, the
common cold is an enormous economic burden on society
in terms of visits to doctors and other health-careproviders, treatments, and absences from work, school, orday care. Every year, in the USA, about 25 million peoplevisit their family doctors with uncomplicated upperrespiratory infections,
2and the common cold syndrome
results in about 20 million days of absence from work and22 million days of absence from school.

Cause
Our knowledge about the cause of the common cold islargely derived from extensive family and communityfollow-up studies undertaken between the 1960s and the

illnesses during the 1950s and 1960s led to the discoveryof adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratorysyncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus, and coronavirus, inaddition to the influenza viruses that had been identified
earlier (figure 1). However, because during that era the
techniques of viral detection were limited to virusisolation, the viral cause could be proven in only about25% of patients with respiratory infections.
7
Improvements in viral detection techniques during thepast two decades, including various viral antigen detectionmethods and particularly the advent of PCR-based assays,have substantially increased the rates of viral detection inclinical specimens.
8,9
The relative proportions of different viruses in the cause
of the common cold vary dependent on several factors,such as age, season, and viral sampling and detectionmethods. However, rhinoviruses have been consistentlyfound to be the most common cause in all age groups,
irrespective of the viral detection techniques used
(panel).
8–12Yearly, rhinoviruses account for about 30–50%
of all respiratory illnesses,6,9but during the autumn peak
season these viruses can cause up to 80% of all upperrespiratory infections.
8More than 100 different serotypes
of rhinoviruses have been identified, the relativeprevalences of which seem to vary between differentgeographical areas and also over the course of time.
10
Although scarce, data are available on the role of
coronaviruses as a cause of the common cold. Theseviruses are found in 7–18% of adults with upperrespiratory infections.

THE LANCET • Vol 361 • January 4, 2003 • www.thelancet.com 51Despite great advances in medicine, the common cold continues to be a great burden on society in terms of human
suffering and economic losses. Of the several viruses that cause the disease, the role of rhinoviruses is mostprominent. About a quarter of all colds are still without proven cause, and the recent discovery of humanmetapneumovirus suggests that other viruses could remain undiscovered. Research into the inflammatorymechanisms of the common cold has elucidated the complexity of the virus-host relation. Increasing evidence is also
available for the central role of viruses in predisposing to complications. New antivirals for the treatment of colds are
being developed, but optimum use of these agents would require rapid detection of the specific virus causing theinfection. Although vaccines against many respiratory viruses could also become available, the ultimate prevention of
the common cold seems to remain a distant aim.
Search strategy 
The data for this seminar were identified by computer-aided
searches of PubMed and Cochrane Library databases, usingkeywords relevant to the different sections. We also reviewedthe journal reference lists and standard textbooks and usedour existing knowledge of the primary publications in this areaand new data presented at international scientific meetings.We then selected reports that, in our understanding, havecontributed substantially to the current knowledge of variousaspects of the common cold, and that also have potential forfurther reading.For personal use. Only reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.adenoviruses, and enteroviruses all account for minor
proportions of the common cold syndrome, but therange of illness caused by each of these viruses alsoincludes other manifestations that can be more typical tothese viruses.
10,12Influenza is often regarded as a disease
entity separate from the common cold. However, theclinical presentation of influenza ranges from anasymptomatic infection to severe illness and it thereforeoverlaps with the common cold. Mild instances of
streptococcal pharyngitis are clinically indistinguishable
from viral pharyngitis and can be misclassified as colds.
Despite the availability of sophisticated diagnostic
methods, about 20–30% of colds remain without aproven viral cause,
6,9probably due in part to
suboptimum methods used in the collection,transportation, and assay of clinical specimens, resultingin underdetection of viruses known to exist. However,many colds could also be caused by infectious agents yet
to be identified. This explanation gained much support
after the recent discovery of a new virus in youngchildren with respiratory infections.15The relative effect of
this virus, tentatively named human metapneumovirus, bycomparison with other respiratory viruses is stillundetermined. Findings of serological studies
15indicate
that the virus has been circulating in human beings for atleast 50 years, and by the age of 5 years virtually allchildren in the Netherlands are infected by it. Reports
16,17
from other countries suggest that human metapneu-movirus has a worldwide distribution.
Two or more viruses are found simultaneously in about
5% of patients with colds.
18However, the rate of dual viral
infection increases proportionally with the number ofdifferent diagnostic methods used,
18and whether or not all
of these cases really represent simultaneous infections bytwo viruses is unclear. Positive findings by PCR, forinstance, do not require the presence of live viruses, andviral genomic materials can be detected in patients long
after the subsidence of clinical symptoms.
19,20
Epidemiology
The occurrence of the common cold shows clear
seasonality. In temperate regions of the northernhemisphere, the frequency of respiratory infectionsincreases rapidly in the autumn, remains fairly highthroughout the winter, and decreases again in the spring.
In tropical areas, most colds arise during the rainy season.
The incidence of upper respiratory infections is inverselyproportional to age (figure 2). On average, the youngestchildren have 6–8 and adults 2–4 colds per year.
5,7During
the first years of life, boys seem to have more respiratoryinfections than girls, but this difference is reversed later inlife.
5Women who work outside the home have fewer
infections that those who do not, which might beexplained by greater exposure to children in those whostay at home.

frequency of colds increases with the number of childrenin the group.
21–23However, frequent infections in the
preschool years could lower the frequency of the commoncold during school years.
23Some genetic factors might also
affect an individual’s susceptibility to respiratoryinfections, but any potential mechanisms remain largelyunidentified.
24,25Psychological stress is associated with
susceptibility to the common cold in a dose-dependentmanner.
26Finally, some reports27indicate that heavy
physical training increases the risk of respiratoryinfections, whereas moderate physical activity coulddecrease risk.
Because of the central role of rhinoviruses in the cause
of the common cold, the epidemiology of this condition
largely parallels that of rhinoviruses. Although rhinovirusescan be detected throughout the year, the incidence ofrhinovirus infections peaks during autumn, with asubsequent smaller outbreak in the spring.
28,29Results of a
follow-up study30showed the high incidence of rhinovirus
infections in children during the first years of life. By age 6months, more than 20% of children had had a laboratory-confirmed rhinovirus infection. By age 2 years, rhinovirusinfection had been documented by virus culture or PCR in
79% of the children, and 91% had antibodies against
rhinoviruses. The average annual rate of rhinovirusinfection is estimated at about 0·8 per person.
28However,
this figure is likely an underestimate, and calculationsbased on PCR data might yield a substantially higher rate.
Many other viruses that cause the common cold tend to
have their own patterns of seasonality. In most temperate
countries, RSV usually causes outbreaks around the turn
of the year,
31but other patterns have also been
documented.32Influenza epidemics also typically occur in
the winter in the northern hemisphere, often overlappingwith RSV.
31,33
The transmission of viruses that cause upper respiratory
infections can occur by any of the three majormechanisms: 1) hand contact with secretions that containthe virus, either directly from an infected person orindirectly from environmental surfaces; 2) small-particle
aerosols lingering in the air for an extended time; or 3)
direct hit by large-particle aerosols from an infectedperson. Although all these mechanisms are likely to beinvolved in the spread of any respiratory virus, the primaryroutes of transmission do differ between viruses. Forinstance, influenza viruses are thought to be spread mainlyvia small-particle aerosols,
34whereas hand contact
followed by self-inoculation with the virus into the nose oreye has been reported as the most efficient way oftransmission for rhinoviruses.
35However, aerosol
transmission of rhinoviruses has also been clearlydocumented.
36Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of the common cold involves a complexinterplay between replicating viruses and the host’sinflammatory response. The detailed pathogeneticmechanisms of the various respiratory viruses can be verydifferent from each other, as indicated by the fact that theprimary site of replication of influenza viruses is in thetracheobronchial epithelium,
34whereas rhinovirus repli-
cation starts predominantly in the nasopharynx.37The
available evidence,38albeit scarce, does not lend support to
the popular belief that colds are associated with chilling orexposure to a cold environment.
Much of our understanding of the pathogenetic events
in the common cold is derived from studies of volunteers
infected with rhinoviruses.
35–37Rhinovirus infection begins
with the deposition of viruses in the anterior nasal mucosaor in the eye, from where they get to the nose via thelacrimal duct. The viruses are then transported to theposterior nasopharynx by mucociliary action. In the
adenoid area, the viruses gain entrance to epithelial cells
by binding to specific receptors on the cells. About 90% ofrhinovirus serotypes use intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) as their receptor.
39,40Once inside the epithelial
cell, the virus starts to replicate rapidly. Progeny virusescan be detected within 8–10 h after intranasal inoculationof rhinoviruses.
41The infectious dose of rhinovirus is
small,42and up to 95% of individuals without antibodies
against the specific viral serotype are infected afterintranasal challenge.
43However, for reasons still unknown,
all infections do not lead to clinical illness; symptomaticcolds develop in only 75% of infected persons.
43The
shedding of rhinoviruses peaks on the second day afterintranasal inoculation and decreases rapidly thereafter, butsmall amounts of viruses can be discovered in nasalsecretions for up to 3 weeks after infection.
37,44
Viral infection of the nasal mucosa results in
vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, which inturn cause nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea, which arethe main clinical symptoms of the common cold.Cholinergic stimulation leads to increased mucous gland
secretion and sneezing. The detailed mechanisms by
which viral infection causes such changes in the nasalmucosa are still incompletely understood. Distinctdifferences exist in the degree of epithelial destructionbetween various respiratory viruses. Whereas influenzaviruses and adenoviruses cause extensive damage to therespiratory epithelium,
45,46no histopathological changes are
observed in nasal biopsy specimens from individualsinfected with rhinoviruses.
37The absence of epithelial
destruction during rhinovirus infections has led to the ideathat the clinical symptoms of the common cold might notbe caused by a direct cytopathic effect of the viruses, butinstead are primarily caused by the inflammatory response
of the host. Extensive research into the role of
inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of thecommon cold has produced evidence for increasedconcentrations of several mediators, such as kinins,leukotrienes, histamine, interleukins 1, 6, and 8, tumournecrosis factor, and RANTES (regulated by activationnormal T cell expressed and secreted) in the nasalsecretions of patients with colds.
47–52The concentrations of
interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 in nasal secretions correlatewith the severity of the symptoms.
53,54The host response
mechanisms triggered by viral infection are, however,interrelated, extremely complex, and far from resolved.For example, in respiratory epithelial cells infected withRSV, interleukin 1 /H9252and tumour necrosis factor /H9251induce
the synthesis of interleukin 8 at 24 h, but partly inhibit thesynthesis of this cytokine at 48 h.

Figure 2: Mean annual incidence of respiratory illnesses per

common cold in the upper respiratory tract is not limitedto the nasal cavity, but that paranasal sinuses are alsofrequently affected. CT scans and plain radiographs ofsinuses obtained during the early course of illness in adults
with colds show substantial abnormalities that usually
resolve spontaneously without antibiotic treatment.
56,57
These findings imply that most sinus abnormalitiesobserved during the common cold are not evidence of abacterial complication, but are instead part of the normalcourse of illness. Findings of an experimental study
58
showed that blowing of the nose creates such a highintranasal pressure that it could propel fluid from the nasalcavity to the paranasal sinuses. Furthermore, rhinovirusRNA has been detected in sinus aspirates even in theabsence of bacteria,
59and results of a study60that used in-
situ hybridisation provide evidence for the presence ofrhinovirus in the epithelial cells of maxillary sinuses inpatients with acute sinusitis.
In adults and children, viral infection of the upper
respiratory tract often causes dysfunction of the Eustachian
tube, which is considered the most important factor in thepathogenesis of acute otitis media.
61Great middle ear
negative pressures are recorded in most preschool andschool-aged children with colds.
62,63In adult volunteers
challenged with rhinoviruses or influenza A viruses, normalEustachian tube function deteriorated in 50–80% ofindividuals.
64,65
Several respiratory viruses—eg, influenza viruses, RSV,
and parainfluenza viruses—can also infect the lowerrespiratory tract, but the ability of rhinoviruses to replicatein the lower airways has been much debated. Althoughrhinoviruses have been detected in secretions obtained
from the lower airways by bronchoscopy,
66potential viral
contamination from the upper respiratory tract was notruled out until recently, when investigators of one study
67
of adult volunteers infected with rhinoviruses avoidedpotential contamination from the upper airways by use ofin-situ hybridisation on bronchial biopsies. The findings ofthe study showed conclusively that rhinoviruses are able toreplicate in the lower airways. 
Clinical manifestations
The symptoms of the common cold arise after anincubation period that can vary considerably betweendifferent viruses. In experimental rhinovirus infections, theonset of symptoms has been reported to occur as soon as10–12 h after intranasal inoculation of the virus,
41whereas
the incubation period of influenza ranges from 1 to 7 days.
34Generally, the severity of the symptoms
increases rapidly, peaks within 2–3 days after infection,and decreases soon after. The mean duration of thecommon cold is 7–10 days, but in a proportion of patientssome symptoms can still be present after 3 weeks.
8,68,69
Rhinovirus infections typically start with a sore throat,
which is soon accompanied by nasal stuffiness anddischarge, sneezing, and cough. The soreness of the throatusually disappears quickly, whereas the initial wateryrhinorrhoea turns thicker and more purulent.
70The
purulence of the nasal discharge is not associated withchanges in the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora
71and is not
considered to indicate a simultaneous bacterial infection ofthe nasal mucosa. Fever is an infrequent finding duringrhinovirus infections in adults, but it is fairly common inchildren with upper respiratory infections of any cause
72,73
Other symptoms associated with the cold syndromeinclude hoarseness, headache, malaise, and lethargy.Myalgia is an occasional complaint in patients with colds,although it is a more typical feature of influenza infection.
34Although the common cold is usually a self-limited
illness of short duration, the viral infection is sometimesaccompanied by a bacterial complication. In children, themost common bacterial complication is acute otitis media,which occurs in about 20% of children with viral upper
respiratory infections.
74,75The seasonal incidence rates of
otitis media closely parallel the general occurrence of viralrespiratory infections,
76,77and the complication is
diagnosed most frequently on days 3 or 4 after the onset ofupper respiratory symptoms.
78,79Findings of studies
indicate that respiratory viruses play a crucial part in thedevelopment of acute otitis media,
61and the detection rates
of different viruses in the middle-ear fluid suggest that atleast some viruses actively invade the middle ear andcontribute to the inflammatory process in the middle earmucosa.
80–83
Other common bacterial complications of viral upper
respiratory infections include sinusitis and pneumonia.Sinusitis has been estimated to occur as a complication in0·5–2% of colds,
12but on the basis of recent evidence for
the high incidence of sinus abnormalities duringapparently uncomplicated colds it is difficult to ascertainwhether changes in paranasal sinuses represent realbacterial complications or whether they are part of the
natural history of the common cold.
56,57Pneumonia
associated with a viral upper respiratory infection is often atrue bacterial complication of the predisposing viral illness,but it can also be a pure extension of the viral illness to thepulmonary level. Research into the microbial cause of
pneumonia has suggested that mixed viral-bacterial
infections are common, especially in children.
84,85
Findings of several studies indicate a clear association
between viral respiratory infections and acuteexacerbations of asthma in both adults and children. In astudy
86of adult patients with asthma, symptoms of the
common cold were reported in 80% of episodes ofwheezing or dyspnoea, and rhinoviruses accounted forabout 60% of those asthma exacerbations for which theviral cause could be identified. The central role of
rhinoviruses in triggering acute exacerbations of asthma
has also been well documented in children.
87In the elderly
population, the overall morbidity due to respiratory virusesother than influenza is often under-rated, although resultsof surveillance studies
13indicate that two thirds of elderly
patients with colds can be expected to develop lowerrespiratory illness. Individuals with chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) form another important riskgroup for viral infections.
88Although the frequencies of
colds are similar in patients with and without COPD, theuse of medical resources, including hospital admissionsand visits to emergency clinics, during viral respiratoryillnesses is substantially increased in patients with COPD.
89
In immunocompromised patients, RSV is usually the mostcommon cause of severe viral respiratory illness, butrhinovirus infections have also been associated with severeand even fatal lower respiratory tract disease.
90
Diagnosis
In most instances, the clinical diagnosis of the commoncold is simple and can be made reliably by adult patientsthemselves.
8However, diagnosis is sometimes problematic
in infants and young children who are not capable ofexpressing their symptoms. Diagnosis in infants isespecially difficult in cases in which fever is the leadingsymptom during the early phase of the infection, and the
doctor is challenged to distinguish benign viral infections
from severe invasive bacterial infections. Allergic orvasomotor rhinitis can sometimes mimic the commoncold, but usually these conditions can be differentiatedSEMINAR
54 THE LANCET • Vol 361 • January 4, 2003 • www.thelancet.comFor personal use. Only reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.easily. The soreness of the throat caused by streptococcal
pharyngitis often resembles the initial symptoms of thecommon cold. However, nasal stuffiness and discharge,which are the primary symptoms of the common cold, areuntypical to streptococcal pharyngitis. Although most
cases of exudative tonsillitis in children are caused by
viruses, the clinical findings on inspection of the pharynxcannot reliably distinguish bacterial from viral tonsillitis.
91
In children, intranasal foreign bodies should be searchedfor in cases of persistent nasal discharge, particularly if thedischarge is unilateral.
Although respiratory infections caused by different
viruses tend to have some variations in their typical clinicalpresentations, the wide range of the clinical manifestationsof each virus makes it virtually impossible to ascertain thespecific virus causing the problem in an individual patientwith the common cold on clinical grounds alone.
14,34,92Even
for influenza, which is often regarded as a distinct diseaseentity among respiratory viral infections, the positivepredictive value of clinical signs and symptoms has rangedbetween 27% and 79%.
93,94
Methods for identification of viruses include viral
culture, antigen detection, and PCR. Isolation of viruses incell cultures is considered the gold standard for detection,but has little value for clinical practice because of theslowness of the process. Immunoperoxidase staining of the
cultures with monoclonal antibodies speeds up viral
identification substantially, with results usually availablewithin 48 h.
95Various antigen detection tests are frequently
used to identify influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses,RSV, and adenoviruses,
96,97but these techniques cannot be
routinely used to detect rhinoviruses because of the hugenumber of different serotypes that exist. Recentlydeveloped rapid antigen detection kits for influenza andRSV can provide results within 15–30 min,
98,99but there
are concerns about the real-life sensitivity and specificity ofthese tests.
100PCR has proved valuable in diagnosis of viral
infections in general, and especially rhinovirus infections,for which other methods have been suboptimum.
8,9,101,102
However, PCR-based techniques are still too laborious foruse in everyday clinical practice, and the extremesensitivity of PCR can pose problems for the interpretationof results.
19,20
Nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal wash specimens are
usually considered the specimens of choice for thedetection of respiratory viruses, but nasal and throat swabsare also often used because of their greater feasibility.
103–106
Scarce data are available on the optimum samplingmethods, and the best sites to collect specimens from forviral detection could differ between viruses.
Treatment
Since the common cold is caused by a multitude ofdifferent virus types with varying pathogeneticmechanisms, that an effective universal treatment for thisdisorder has not been developed is understandable. Thesymptomatic treatment of colds has been aimed at
relieving the most disturbing symptoms of the illness, and
hundreds of different over-the-counter preparations areavailable.
107,108Although antibiotics are not effective against
viruses, they are widely used in the treatment ofuncomplicated viral upper respiratory infections.
2,109
Most patients find nasal stuffiness and discharge the
most bothersome symptoms of the common cold.8Nasal
blockage can be effectively reduced with intranasally ororally administered decongestants.
110First-generation (but
not second-generation) antihistamines reduce sneezingand rhinorrhoea, probably because of their anticholinergicrather than antihistamine effects.
111Results of severalstudies have also shown the efficacy of local ipratropium inreducing rhinorrhoea.
112Theoretically, corticosteroids as
potent anti-inflammatory agents could be thought toeffectively reduce nasal symptoms, but results of clinicalstudies of either intranasal or oral steroids have shown noclinical benefit.
44,69,113The use of intranasal steroids in
children during rhinovirus infection could even increasethe risk of acute otitis media.
114Cough medications, both
antitussives and mucolytic agents, are frequently used,
although their efficacy has been poorly shown.115Non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce fever andsoreness of the throat, and might also have some beneficialeffect on cough.
116Data on the efficacy of zinc in reducing
the severity and duration of colds are still inconclusive.117
At present, specific antiviral treatments for respiratory
viruses are commercially available only for influenzaviruses. The usability of amantadine and rimantadine islimited by their side-effects, their inefficacy againstinfluenza B viruses, and the rapid development of resistant
viral strains during treatment.
118The new influenza-specific
antivirals, zanamivir and oseltamivir, have fewer side-effects and are effective against both influenza A and Bviruses. When treatment is initiated within 48 h of theonset of symptoms, the duration of the clinical illness is
reduced by 1–2 days with either of these drugs.
119,120Scarce
evidence exists for the efficacy of these drugs in theprevention of bacterial complications, especially in high-risk patients,
121but early treatment of influenza with
oseltamivir does reduce the development of acute otitismedia in children by more than 40%.
122
Because of the leading role of rhinoviruses in the
common cold, effective antivirals against rhinovirusescould be expected to have the greatest effect in thetreatment of this disease. In the 1980s, much hope was laidon the use of interferon, but disappointingly it provided nobenefit in the treatment of naturally occurring colds orexperimental rhinovirus infections.
123,124The discovery ofSEMINAR

For personal use. Only reproduce with permission from The Lancet Publishing Group.ICAM-1 as the main cellular receptor for rhinoviruses led
to attempts to block the attachment of the virus to thereceptor, using a recombinant soluble decoy ICAM-1.Findings of clinical trials showed that this approach couldreduce the severity of experimental rhinovirus infections,
but the effect was modest.
125
Recent advances in antirhinoviral drugs include the
development of pleconaril, a novel viral capsid binder, andruprintrivir, a human rhinovirus 3C protease inhibitor.
126–128
Pleconaril is administered orally and is active against awide range of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Findings ofearly clinical trials have indicated that when pleconariltreatment is instituted within 24–36 h of the onset of symptoms, the duration of illness is reduced by 
1–1·5 days.
129
Increasing knowledge about the central role of the host
inflammatory response in producing the symptoms of thecommon cold has led to attempts to treat colds withcombinations of antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents.
130
In a recent trial131in adults challenged with rhinoviruses,
the combination of intranasal interferon with oralchlorphenamine and ibuprofen showed effect in reducingnot only nasal but also several other symptoms of theillness.
Prevention
The diversity of the viral cause of the common cold hashampered prevention as well as treatment initiatives. In theabsence of a suitable common antigen across the widerange of rhinovirus serotypes, the prospects fordevelopment of a vaccine against rhinoviruses seem poor.
Influenza is the only respiratory infection for which a
vaccine is commercially available. In addition to thepresent inactivated influenza vaccine, which isadministered intramuscularly, new types of influenzavaccines for intranasal administration have beendeveloped.
132–134Several types of vaccines against RSV and
parainfluenza viruses are also being developed and are inearly clinical trials.
135–137
The antiviral drug approach to prevention of respiratory
infections is currently to influenza, for which the efficacy ofthe specific antivirals has been shown for both seasonalprophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis withinfamilies.
138–142Contrary to the lack of effect in the treatment
of rhinovirus infections, the prophylactic efficacy ofintranasally administered interferon has been welldemonstrated, but the unacceptably high rate of nasaladverse events during extended administration has
decreased enthusiasm about its use for prevention of
colds.
143In a proof of concept study,144intranasally
administered immunoglobulin reduced episodes of rhinitisin children, but no further investigations of passiveimmunisation of the nasal mucosa have been published. 
Despite the widespread use of vitamin C and extracts of
the plant Echinacea for the prevention of the common
cold, conclusive evidence for such an effect is stilllacking.
145,146In view of the available data, it seems obvious
that complete prevention of colds would only be possibleby total long-term isolation from the community.
147While
waiting for the next ship bound for Antarctica, however,many people might find solace in a report
148that suggests
that intake of wine, especially red wine, may have aprotective effect against the common cold.
Future considerations
Together with the substantial proportion of colds withouta proven microbial cause, the recent discovery of humanmetapneumovirus suggests that other importantrespiratory viruses might still remain undetected, and theuse of highly sophisticated molecular techniques couldlead to new discoveries. Further research into the hostinflammatory response and viral-bacterial interactionduring the common cold might reveal pathways that couldserve as targets for intervention to better alleviate the
symptoms and to prevent the development of
complications. Optimum use of the newly available andforthcoming antiviral agents is likely to increase the needfor simple, rapid, inexpensive, and accurate point-of-caretests to identify the specific virus causing the infection onan individual level. In this era of ever-increasingantimicrobial resistance of bacteria, efforts aimed at theeducation of people about the ineffectiveness of antibiotics
in the treatment of uncomplicated colds should be
intensified.

Bawaskar Hospital and Research Center, Mahad Raigad, Maharashtra, India 402301 (H S Bawaskar MD)A 16-year-old boy was bitten on his finger by a krait at 
0300 h when sleeping on the floor of his hut. He reported tomy clinic at 0500 h. He walked into my examination room,but he had bilateral ptosis, bulbar palsy, and was unable totalk. I gave him antivenom and intravenous atropine and
neostigamine. As soon as I removed the intravenous needle,
he vomited, aspirated, and died. A patient paralysed from anelapid snake bite should be treated in a semi-prone positionand intubated. 
A 6-year-old boy was stung by a scorpion and admitted to
a rural hospital. I was called to examine the child. He hadsigns suggestive of an autonomic storm. I advised oralprazosin, and the staff nurse handed over the prazosin tablet
to the mother for administration. The child refused to take
the tablet, and the mother did not insist, as she was happythat the nurse gave him tetanus toxoid and scorpionantivenin injections. The child developed pulmonaryoedema, and the medical officer transferred him to a cottagehospital without calling me. The child died on the way.Prazosin is an antidote to venom and should be
administered by a doctor or nurse. One should confirm thatit has started acting by observing lowering blood pressure,improvement in peripheral circulation, a reduction in the
heart rate and reappearance of local pain at the site of sting
which was mild or absent due to vasoconstriction. 
A 62-year-old retired man came alone from Mumbai to
visit his village. He developed chest pain and bystandersbrought him to my clinic. His electrocardiogram showedan extensive acute anterior myocardial infarction. I sedatedhim and gave him aspirin. I wanted to give him steptok-inase but the bystanders would not pay, as they were notrelatives. He was packed back to Mumbai, where he was
admitted in cardiogenic shock and died within 
12 h of admission. We have since kept 1·5 million units ofstreptokinase in the treatment room and given it topatients with acute myocardial infarct, without pre-payment. We have treated 74 patients like this with goodresults.
